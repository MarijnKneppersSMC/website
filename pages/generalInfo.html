	Machine Learning, often referred to as ML, is the science of making computers advance their "knowledge" using data with little
	to no human interference.
</p>

<p>
	There are three main types of Machine Learning: Supervised learning, unsupervised learning and reinforcement learning.
</p>

<p>
	Supervised learning algorithms first get a basic idea of their task by learning from training data. The training data is
	data curated by humans from the Machine Learning algorithm to learn from. After this, the Machine Learning algorithm is
	fed data that it has not yet trained on. Using this, it makes predictions of what it thinks will be the correct answer.
	After guessing an answer, it gets fed the answer and it can improve itself if the guess was incorrect.
</p>

<p>
	Unsupervised learning algorithms are similar to supervised learning algorithms but do not get fed training data. It has to
	find meaning and order in the data it is provided by itself. This can be a goal in itself. Finding order or sequences in
	data.

	The final one is quite different from the other two. A reinforcement learning algorithm is provided with a dynamic environment
	on every sequence that varies between sequences. The algorithm is provided with a certain task. For example, drive a car.
	As it proceeds to try and complete its task, it is provided with points when it is doing good. It will try to maximize the
	number of points it gets. It will also get penalties when it fails to execute its task. The algorithm will try to minimize
	these punishments.

<p>
	There are a lot more types of machine learning, but these are the three most prominent ones. You may now be wondering what
	the use is of Machine Learning. Machine Learning can be applied in situations where it is nearly impossible to write an
	efficient and effective algorithm to complete a certain task. Some examples are speech recognition and computer vision.
