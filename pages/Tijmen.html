<h3>Some things about me:</h3>

<p>
	I'm 15 years old, and like stated before in my fourth learning year at the Sint-Maartenscollege in Voorburg, the Netherlands. I'm in the bilingual program
	<br>
	My hobbies are scouting and playing the piano. I've been playing the piano for about 6 years, and I've also been doing scouting for about 6 years now. 
</p>

<p>
	I'm capable of speaking 4 languages in total, though I'm far from fluent in some. Those 4 are:
	<ol>
		<li>Dutch</li>
		<li>English</li>
			<ul>
				<li>Dutch and English are fluent</li>
			</ul>
		<li>German</li>
		<li>French</li>
			<ul>
				<li>German and French aren't fluent</li>
			</ul>
	</ol>
</p>

<p>
	I have basically no experience concerning writing code, so this was a good opportunity to 	learn a bit more. And learning new things which are in my interest is something I won't decline easily.
