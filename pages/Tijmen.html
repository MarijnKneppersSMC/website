<p>
	So some more things about me:
</p>

<br>
	
<p>
	I'm 15 years old, and like stated before in my fourth learning year at the Sint-Maartenscollege in Voorburg, the Netherlands. I'm in the bilingual program
</p>
	


<p>
	My hobbies are scouting and playing the piano. I've been playing the piano for about 6 years, and I've also been doing scouting for about 6 years now. 
</p>


<p>
	I have basically no experience concerning writing code, so this was a good opportunity to 	learn a bit more. And learning new things which are in my interest is something I won't decline easily.
