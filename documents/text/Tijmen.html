<p>
	So more about me:
	<br>
	I'm 15 years old, and like stated before in my fourth learning year at the Sint-Maartenscollege in Voorburg, the Netherlands. I'm in the bilingual program
</p>

<p>
	My hobbies are playing the piano and scouting. I've played piano for about 5 years, and I've been doing scouting for about 6 years now. 
</p>

<p>
  	I have basically no experience concerning writing code, so this was a good opportunity to learn a bit more. And learning new things which are in my interest is something I won't decline easily.
