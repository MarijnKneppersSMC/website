	Machine Learning has a lot of real world applications. Here, we will be looking at 2 uses. One that has a real world use and one that is fun.
</p>

<p>
	The first thing we will be looking at is GPT-3 (Generative Pre-trained Transformer 3). GPT-3 was created by OpenAI and is the third generation of the GPT-n series. GPT-3 is a Machine Learning algorithm specifically made to be able to generate text although it is also capable of writing basic code. GPT-3 has become so good that it has become next to impossible to disguise between text written by GPT-3 and text written by humans. Outside of it's higher capability to generate text, the text that is produced is significantly less toxic then it's predecesors.

	An example of an application of GPT-3 can be found below:

	Machine Learning does not always need to be useful. Machine Learning can be found everywhere. You can write a Machine Learning algorithm to learn somethin new, to automate a boring task or to just play your game.
