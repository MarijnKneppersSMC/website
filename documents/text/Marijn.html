<p>
	I'm 15 years old programming enthousiast currently following classes at the Sint-Maartenscollege in Voorburg, the Netherlands.
</p>

<p>
	My biggest hobbies are programming and gaming. I have been programming on and off since the age of 8 using all kinds of languages from javacript to java to c# and even c. Recently I have been playing some cult classic games like Halo and the Witcher.
</p>

<p>
	Although I have been programming for quite some time, I don't really have a lot of big projects. Some of my biggest works are <a href="https://youtu.be/X9eepvTdMLQ">Fyremoth</a>, a big mod for Hollow Knight and <a href="https://mandar1jn.itch.io/planet-clash">Planet Clash</a>, a game made in 24 hours using c99 and <a href="https://www.raylib.com/">raylib</a> for <a href="https://itch.io/jam/raylib-5k-gamejam">the raylib 5K jam</a>.
